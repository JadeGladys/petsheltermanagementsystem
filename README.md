1.	Introduction

    1.1	Purpose
        The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the animal shelter website.
        This document will serve as a blueprint for the development team to ensure that the website meets the needs
        of the animal shelter and its users.

    1.2	Scope
        The animal shelter website will focus heavily on promoting pet adoption and providing a user-friendly platform
        for potential adopters to view and learn about the animals available for adoption. The website will showcase
        the shelter's services, including volunteering opportunities, and information on spaying and neutering,
        as well as offering resources and information on pet care and ownership. In addition, the website will provide
        a simple and accessible way for pet owners to surrender their animals to the shelter instead of abandoning them,
        ultimately helping to reduce the number of animals living on the streets.

2.	Overall Description

    2.1	Product Perspective
        The animal shelter website will be a standalone web application that will be hosted on a web server.
        Users will access the website using a web browser on their desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile device.

    2.2	Product Features The animal shelter website will include the following features:

        Adoption Functionality
        Volunteer Functionality
        Surrender Functionality
        Content Management Functionality
        Analytics Functionality
        Mobile Responsiveness

    2.3	User Characteristics

        The animal shelter website will cater to two primary user groups: potential pet adopters and
        current or potential shelter supporters. Potential pet adopters will be interested in browsing
        adoptable animals and learning more about the adoption process, while current or potential shelter
        supporters will be interested in learning about the shelter's services and how to get involved.
